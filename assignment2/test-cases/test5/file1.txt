There was a time in his life when her rudeness would have set him over the edge.
He would have raised his voice and demanded to speak to the manager.
That was no longer the case. He barely reacted at all, letting the rudeness melt away without saying a word back to her.
He had been around long enough to know where rudeness came from and how unhappy the person must be to act in that way.
All he could do was feel pity and be happy that he didn't feel the way she did to lash out like that.
